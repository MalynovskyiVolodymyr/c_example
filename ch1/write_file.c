/* * *
 * The line fseek (fp, 10, SEEK_CUR) moves the file
 * pointer 10 bytes ahead of the current position, 
 * so this program will print all but the first 
 * ten characters in the file. 
 * The first argument to fseek is the file pointer; 
 * the second is the offset by which the pointer is to move.
 * This can be positive or negative; so fseek (fp, -5, SEEK_CUR)
 * moves the pointer 5 bytes back from the current position.
 * The third argument to fseek allows you to choose a position 
 * relative to the start of the file ( SEEK_SET ) or the end of the file
 * ( SEEK_END ) rather than the current position ( SEEK_CUR ).
 * So fseek (fp, 12, SEEK_SET) positions the 
 * pointer 12 bytes ahead of the start of the file,
 * while fseek (fp, -17, SEEK_END) positions it 17 bytes
 * back from the end of the file. *
